# Power-BI
This is my first Fast Track interactive Power BI Dashboard which I published in github.<br />
This Dashboard indicates Interactive Sales Reporting by Creating dynamic reports with charts, tables, and slicers for insightful data visualization.<br />
Time Intelligence Analysis was done Performing year-over-year and year-to-date calculations without complex coding using Quick Measures.<br />
Map and Line Chart Visualizations were added by Enhancing the dashboard with trend-tracking line charts.<br />
